### Getting started with GitLab
This is my first feedback.

### HTML introduction
HTML introduction was discussed clearly and shown in a way that would be easy to understand by beginners and also a good form of review to those who have a background.  
Nice flow of topic.

### Night 11
Topics covered so far were taught in a way that is easy to understand.  
I like the flow of topic and how Sir Billy keeps it that way. Present topic is always related to the previous and a prerequisite of the next one. I noticed how he avoids skipping which I think is a good way to avoid confusion.
